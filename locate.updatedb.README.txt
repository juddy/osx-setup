The stock `/usr/libexec/locate.updatedb` contains these lines:

	if [ "$(id -u)" = "0" ]; then
		rc=0
		export FCODES=`mktemp -t updatedb`
		chown nobody $FCODES
		tmpdb=`su -fm nobody -c "$0"` || rc=1
		if [ $rc = 0 ]; then
			install -m 0444 -o nobody -g wheel $FCODES /var/db/locate.database
		fi
		rm $FCODES
		exit $rc
	fi

Translation: if you run this as `root` we're going to run it as `nobody` and you're going to miss files.

So I either comment out those lines or remove them, and then run

	sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist
